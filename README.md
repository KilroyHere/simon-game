My Implementation of the Simon Game.
This was one of the projects from "The Web Developer Bootcamp 2020" from Udemy,Inc.

Following Editions may include:
High Score and User Login System.

Game Playable at: http://aryanpatel.net/simon-game/

Rules to Play:
Press the A to START . Simon will give the first signal. Repeat the signal by pressing the same color lens.

Simon will add one to this and you must repeat the previous sequence by memorizing it. 

Repeat these two signals by pressing the same color lenses, in order.

Continue playing as long as you can repeat each sequence of signals correctly. 

If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly, Simon responds with a "RAZZ" sound. This means you've lost, and the sequence of signals ends.
